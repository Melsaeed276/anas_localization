## In Memory of Anas Al-Sharif

| This package is dedicated to the memory of Anas Al-Sharif, a Palestinian journalist for Al Jazeera in Gaza. Anas was martyred while reporting in August 2025, courageously bringing truth to the world.

# Flutter/Dart Localization Package

This package provides a comprehensive solution for localization in Flutter and Dart applications. It supports runtime dictionary generation, JSON-based translations, pluralization, named and positional parameters, gender support (male/female only), and merging of package and app assets for seamless localization management.

## Features

- Merge app and package JSON localizations with app override.
- Runtime fallback to package localization if an app key is missing.
- Pluralization support using the `PluralForm` enum.
- Gender-specific messages supporting male and female variants.
- Named (`{name}`) and positional (`{}`) parameters with optional (`{name?}`) and required (`{name!}`) syntax.
- Support for multiple currency/localization variants inside a single key.
- Validation of variable consistency across all supported languages.

## Getting started

Add the package to your `pubspec.yaml` dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  localization_package: ^0.0.1
```

Run `flutter pub get` or `dart pub get` to install the package.

## Usage

1. Add your JSON localization files in your Flutter/Dart project assets, for example:

```
assets/lang/en.json
assets/lang/es.json
```

2. Run the localization generator:

```bash
dart run localization:localization_gen
```

3. Access your translations in code:

```dart
final dictionary = Localization.of(context);

print(dictionary.hello);
print(dictionary.itemsCount(count: 5));
```

## Advanced Usage

### Pluralization

```json
{
  "itemsCount": {
    "zero": "No items",
    "one": "One item",
    "other": "{count} items"
  }
}
```

```dart
dictionary.itemsCount(count: 3);
```

### Gender-specific messages

```json
{
  "welcome": {
    "male": "Welcome, sir!",
    "female": "Welcome, ma'am!"
  }
}
```

```dart
dictionary.welcome(gender: Gender.male);
```

### Currency and localization variants

```json
{
  "price": {
    "usd": "\${amount}",
    "eur": "â‚¬{amount}"
  }
}
```

```dart
dictionary.price(currency: 'usd', amount: 10);
```

### Named and positional parameters

```json
{
  "greeting": "Hello, {name!}!",
  "farewell": "Goodbye, {name?}."
}
```

```dart
dictionary.greeting(name: 'Alice'); // Required parameter
dictionary.farewell(); // Optional parameter
```
